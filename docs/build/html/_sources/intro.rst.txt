introduction
============


These docs serve the purpose to contain all information about ATC's P8 smartwatch custom firmware.

The smartwatch has many great features like:

* Bluetooth-LE, 
* Heart-rate-sensor, 
* pedometer, 
* imu, 
* color/touch screen 
* external button
* it is waterproof

ATC1441 (Aaron) is the creator and precursor of this idea.
