^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TL;DR; 
you download the D6Arduino.rar, use it as a portable arduino or Windows. In the directory, where arduino.exe is located, you will find .rar file that can be used to flash the firmware with OTA procedure.
The code can be flashed directly through Arduino using ST-link as showed in the :ref:`Hardware overview` chapter

the repository, where all arduino files needed for compiling the code are available `here <https://atcnetz.de/downloads/D6Arduino.rar>`_.

and the video explaining how to use it is `here2 <https://youtu.be/3gjmEdEDJ5A>`_.

the repository with ATC's P8 arduino code is `here3 <https://github.com/atc1441/ATCwatch>`_.
