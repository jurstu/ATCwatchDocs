   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.


Introduction
============


These docs serve the purpose to contain all information about ATC's P8 smartwatch custom firmware.

The P8 smartwatch has many great features like:

* Bluetooth-LE, 
* Heart-rate-sensor, 
* pedometer, 
* imu, 
* color/touch screen 
* has 1 external button
* it is waterproof


It can be programed with Arduino, and flashed without opening with an app ATC wrote.
